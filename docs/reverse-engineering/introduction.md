# Introduction

## What to expect

The majority of the challenges are programs written in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and compiled for [x64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64) architecture linux machines.
This means that the player is provided an [ELF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format) file. With the help of a tool called [disassembler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disassembler), the file can be translated from machine code into [assembly language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language). A tool called [decompiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompiler) can then try to translate the assembly back into  high-level source code like C code.
The player then tries to make sense of the source code to find out what the program is doing exactly.
Oftentimes, the player has to dig into the assembly code generated by the disassembler, because decompilers often make mistakes or fail to decompile parts of the code.

Other types of challenges include Android Apps (apk format) that are written in Java or Kotlin.
