The term to pwn \[/po än/\] originally comes from the gaming community and means the verb to own.
In cybersecurity, it refers to gaining unauthorized control over a system or exploiting it.

## What to expect
In the pwn category, the user is provided a copy of a program that runs on a remote server. The user has to find a vulnerability in said program and exploit it to gain control of the remote server and to read the contents of files there. The flag is normally written in the file `/flag.txt` on the remote server.
