# Introduction

## What to expect

Cryptography is all about encrypting messages securely. Sometimes, these encryptions are not done securely. The goal of the challenges in this category is to find a vulnerability in the cryptographic function that is being used and decrypt the secret message (the flag).

## Types of challenges
- Cracking classic cryptography like transposition ciphers or substitution ciphers
- Cracking modern ciphers (like RSA or AES) that have an unsecure configuration
- Cracking an unsecure random number generator

## Skills required (or Motivation to learn)
- Recognizing classic ciphers
- Willing to learn mathematical concepts around modern cryptography
