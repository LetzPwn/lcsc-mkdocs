## What CTFs are about

In the context of cybersecurity, a CTF, short for "Capture the flag", is a type of challenge, where the goal is to find a hidden string of characters, the flag.

In order to get the flag, the player usually has to break or hack into systems and do things a usual user is not supposed to be able to do.

Common examples of CTF challenges are

- getting into admin-panels of websites you are not supposed to access (cf. [WEB SECURITY](web/introduction.md))
- decrypting secret messages you are not supposed to be able to read. (cf. [CRYPTOGRAPHY](cryptography/introduction.md))
- corrupting programs to do things they are not intended to do. (cf. [BINARY EXPLOITATION](binary-exploitation/introduction.md))

CTFs can also be about finding out what exactly a program is doing or what has happened on a specific system.
This includes:

- Examining and reverse engineering binary programs or mobile applications. (cf. [REVERSE ENGINEERING](reverse-engineering/introduction.md))
- Solving a digital forensics case. (cf. [DIGITAL FORENSICS](digital-forensics/introduction.md))
- Analyzing network traffic to discover vulnerabilities in protocols (cf. [NETWORK ANALYSIS](network-analysis/introduction.md))

Less common, but still present, are challenges like

- Getting secret information from a microcontroller using side-channel analysis (cf. [HARDWARE SECURITY](hardware-security/introduction.md))
- gathering information about a fictional target using publicly available sources like social media (cf. [OSINT](osint/introduction.md))
